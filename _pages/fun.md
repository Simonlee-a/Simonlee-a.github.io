Recently it occured to me that it's important for us to never stop doing things that we're bad at doing.
There are two main reasons: (1) you might actually have fun doing it and (2) it will make you a more empathetic person.
In 2022 I started taking singing as a hobby more seriously because I had a lot of room to improve, I could do it while waiting for stuff to run, and it costs $0 to do.

While I look for the next such thing, you can stay on top of where I am on this hobby:

- "Fly me to the moon" with guitar by Seewoo Li ([originally by Frank Sinatra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEcqHA7dbwM))
