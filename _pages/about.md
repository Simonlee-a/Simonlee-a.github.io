Hi! My name is Simon Lee. I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Computational Medicine](https://compmed.ucla.edu/profile/lee-simon) Department at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) working with Prof. Jeffrey Chiang. Previously, I worked as a data science researcher at Celsius Therapeutics exploring immunology cell quantification through deconvolution methods for our Phase I clinical trials. Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics and also studied abroad at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) in Switzerland. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with people, traveling, eating, and discovering the mysteries of the world.  

Feel free to reach out to me at *simonlee711 [at] g [dot] ucla [dot] edu*.
